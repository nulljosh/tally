## Running The Numbers

**After $5.5K debt payoff: ~$6.5K to allocate**

### Option A: Car → Job
**Pros:**
- Unlocks job market (way more options than transit-only)
- Could generate $20K+/year income

**Cons:**
- Car costs: Insurance ($150-300/month), gas ($100-200), maintenance
- Cheapest reliable car: ~$5-8K (eats most of your $6.5K)
- Do you even want a job?

**Verdict:** ❌ Not worth it right now

---

### Option B: Computer Setup
**Pros:**
- Enables building (you're already a builder/calculator)
- Could generate income (freelance, projects, apps)
- One-time cost (~$2-3K for solid desktop setup)
- Leaves $3-4K for other stuff

**Cons:**
- MacBook Pro 2026 already handles most things
- Diminishing returns unless you have specific compute-heavy needs

**Verdict:** ✅ Good investment if you have build ideas

---

### Option C: Dog
**Pros:**
- Emotional support (legit mental health benefit)
- Routine/structure
- Companionship

**Cons:**
- Ongoing cost: $100-200/month (food, vet, etc.)
- Limits mobility/flexibility
- Expensive black swan risk (vet emergencies $500-5K)

**Verdict:** ⏸️ Wait until stable monthly income

---

### Option D: SPY/VOO Index Funds
**Pros:**
- Historical ~10% annual return
- $6.5K → $17K in 10 years (with no additions)
- No ongoing costs
- Liquid if you need it

**Cons:**
- Doesn't generate immediate income or quality of life improvement
- Just sits there growing slowly

**Verdict:** ✅ Safety net that compounds

---

## Investment Strategy (Final Decision)

**Phase 1:** Pay off debt ($5,500) ✅
**Phase 2:** Computer setup ($2,000) - enables building/income
**Phase 3:** SPY/VOO index funds ($4,500) - liquid safety net
**Phase 4:** Let it grow while building projects

**Why this works:**
- Computer unlocks income without job slavery
- Index funds = safety net + compound growth
- Stay flexible, keep building, no new ongoing costs

**Long-term:** Dog when PWD monthly upgrade kicks in ($1,735/month)
