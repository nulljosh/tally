# Claimcheck

*"Check your cheques without the bureaucracy."*

Multi-user BC Self-Serve portal scraper with DTC (Disability Tax Credit) eligibility navigator.

## How It Works

![Workflow Diagram](docs/workflow.svg)

**Quick summary:**
1. Login with BC Self-Serve credentials
2. Script validates & encrypts credentials in session
3. Puppeteer scrapes benefits data (30-60s)
4. Upload to Vercel Blob for instant dashboard load
5. View benefits, messages, DTC eligibility calculator

## Features

### ✅ Implemented (v2.0)
- **Multi-user authentication** - Each user logs in with their own BC Self-Serve credentials
- **Secure credential handling** - AES-256-CBC encryption, session-based storage, never logged
- **Rate limiting** - 5 login attempts per 15 minutes
- **Session security** - 2-hour max age, 1-hour activity timeout, httpOnly/secure/SameSite cookies
- **Auto-login fallback** - Uses .env credentials if login fields left blank (admin convenience)
- **Vercel Blob integration** - Dashboard loads instantly from cached data
- **DTC Navigator** - Free eligibility screener for Disability Tax Credit and BC PWD
- **Automated scraping** - Notifications, Messages, Payment Info, Service Requests

### 🔧 TODO
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel production
- [ ] Add cron job for automatic scraping
- [ ] Multi-tenant storage (per-user Blob keys)
- [ ] T2201 form pre-filler (DTC application)
- [ ] Email notifications for benefit updates

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Local Development
```bash
# 1. Create .env file (optional - for auto-login)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your BC Self-Serve credentials

# 2. Start server
npm start

# 3. Visit http://localhost:3000
# Login with BC Self-Serve credentials (or leave blank to use .env)
```

### Running Scraper
```bash
# Scrape BC Self-Serve (saves to data/ folder)
npm run check

# Upload latest results to Vercel Blob
npm run upload-blob
```

## Security

### What Changed (v2.0)
- ❌ Removed `/api/default-credentials` endpoint (was leaking credentials)
- ✅ Added authentication to `/api/latest` endpoint
- ✅ Login validates credentials with actual BC Self-Serve login attempt
- ✅ Credentials encrypted in session (AES-256-CBC)
- ✅ Rate limiting on login attempts
- ✅ .env file excluded from git (.gitignore)

### Important
- ⚠️ **Never commit .env files** - Already in .gitignore
- ⚠️ **Change your BC Self-Serve password** if credentials were previously exposed
- ⚠️ **SESSION_SECRET** should be random in production (auto-generated if not set)

## Deployment (Vercel)

### 1. Set Environment Variables
In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:
```
UPLOAD_SECRET=<random-string>  # Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
SESSION_SECRET=<random-string>  # Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
```

### 2. Enable Blob Storage
Vercel Dashboard → Storage → Blob → Enable
(Auto-creates `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`)

### 3. Deploy
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### 4. Upload Data
```bash
# Run locally to scrape and upload
npm run check
npm run upload-blob
```

### 5. Access Dashboard
Visit https://claimcheck.vercel.app
- Dashboard loads instantly from Blob cache
- "Check Now" button won't work on Vercel (Puppeteer timeout)
- Must scrape locally and upload

## Architecture

### Local Dev
```
User → Login (validates credentials) → Session (encrypted) → Scraper (Puppeteer) → Dashboard
```

### Vercel Production
```
User → Login (validates) → Session → Dashboard (reads from Blob)
                                         ↑
Local Machine → Scraper → Upload Script → Vercel Blob (instant load)
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Description |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| `/api/login` | POST | No | Validate BC Self-Serve credentials (rate limited) |
| `/api/logout` | POST | No | Destroy session |
| `/api/latest` | GET | Yes | Get cached dashboard data |
| `/api/check` | GET | No | Trigger scrape (uses session/env credentials) |
| `/api/upload` | POST | Token | Upload to Vercel Blob (requires UPLOAD_SECRET) |
| `/api/dtc/screen` | POST | No | DTC eligibility calculator |

## Development Notes

### Testing Login
```bash
# Test invalid credentials
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"wrong","password":"wrong"}'

# Test .env fallback (leave fields blank)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

### Testing Blob Upload
```bash
# Upload latest results
npm run upload-blob

# Verify on Vercel
curl https://claimcheck.vercel.app/api/latest
```
