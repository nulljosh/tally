# Canadian Retirement Benefits Guide (BC)

*Last updated: February 2026*

## 1. Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

**What:** Monthly pension based on work contributions.

| | Amount (Jan 2026) |
|---|---|
| Maximum at age 65 | $1,507.65/mo |
| Average payment | ~$899.67/mo |
| Average for new recipients | ~$803.76/mo |

**Eligibility:** Age 60+, at least one CPP contribution ever made.

**Early/Late:**
- Age 60-64: Reduced 0.6%/month (up to -36% at 60)
- Age 66-70: Increased 0.7%/month (up to +42% at 70)

**How to apply:** NOT automatic. Apply via My Service Canada Account (online, ~2 weeks) or paper form ISP-1000 (~6 months). Call: 1-800-277-9914

## 2. Old Age Security (OAS)

**What:** Monthly pension for 65+ based on years living in Canada (not work).

| | Amount (Jan-Mar 2026) |
|---|---|
| Age 65-74 (max) | $742.31/mo |
| Age 75+ (max) | $816.54/mo (10% bonus at 75) |

**Eligibility:** 65+, Canadian citizen/legal resident, 10+ years in Canada after 18 (40 years = full pension).

**Automatic enrollment:** Service Canada auto-enrolls most people. Letter arrives month after turning 64.

**Clawback:** Starts at $93,454 income (15 cents per dollar above). Not a concern for low-income seniors.

## 3. Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) - THE BIG ONE

**What:** Tax-free monthly supplement for low-income seniors already on OAS.

| Situation | Max Monthly | Income Must Be Under |
|---|---|---|
| Single/widowed/divorced | $1,108.74/mo | $22,488/yr |
| Couple, both on OAS | $667.41/mo each | $29,712 combined |
| Couple, partner no OAS | $1,108.74/mo | $53,904 combined |

**Key:** GIS is TAX-FREE. CPP counts as income for GIS purposes. OAS does not.

**How to apply:** Auto-assessed when you apply for OAS. Renewed automatically IF you file taxes by April 30 every year. Call: 1-800-277-9914

## 4. BC Senior's Supplement

**What:** Provincial top-up for lowest-income seniors on GIS.

| Situation | Amount |
|---|---|
| Single senior | Up to $99.30/mo |
| Senior couple | Up to $220.50/mo |

**Fully automatic.** No application needed. Starts month after first OAS/GIS payment.

## 5. Allowance (Age 60-64)

| Type | Max Monthly | Income Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Allowance (spouse on OAS+GIS) | $1,409.72/mo | <$41,616 combined |
| Allowance for Survivor (widowed) | $1,680.47/mo | <$30,312 individual |

Both tax-free. Apply through Service Canada.

## Typical ~$2,000/Month Breakdown

| Benefit | Amount |
|---|---|
| CPP (modest) | ~$400-500 |
| OAS (full) | ~$742 |
| GIS (partial) | ~$700-850 |
| BC Senior's Supplement | ~$50-99 |
| **Total** | **~$1,900-2,150** |

A single senior with ZERO CPP + full OAS + full GIS + BC Supplement = **$1,951/mo tax-free**
