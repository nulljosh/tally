# Pentesting ELI5 - How to Get Into Cybersecurity

## What is Penetration Testing?

**ELI5:** Penetration testing (pentesting) is breaking into computer systems *on purpose* to find weaknesses before bad guys do. It's like hiring someone to try to break into your house to show you which locks are weak.

**Real Version:** Authorized security testing where you simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities. You get paid to hack (legally).

## Core Concepts

### 1. Attack Surface
Everything an attacker can access:
- Login pages
- API endpoints
- File uploads
- User input fields
- Network ports

### 2. Vulnerability Types (OWASP Top 10)
- **Injection** - Trick the database with malicious code (SQL injection)
- **Broken Auth** - Bypass login, steal sessions, bruteforce passwords
- **XSS** - Inject JavaScript into pages to steal data
- **SSRF** - Make the server attack itself
- **Authorization** - Access things you shouldn't (other users' data)

### 3. Pentesting Phases
1. **Reconnaissance** - Map the target (nmap, subfinder, whatweb)
2. **Scanning** - Find vulnerabilities (run tools, analyze code)
3. **Exploitation** - Prove it works (write a working exploit)
4. **Reporting** - Document findings with PoC

## How to Get Started (Using Claude + Mac)

### Phase 1: Learn the Basics (Week 1-2)

**Read:**
- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)

**Practice Platforms:**
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) - Beginner friendly
- [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.com) - More advanced
- [PortSwigger Labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs) - Free, excellent

**Claude Code Tip:** Ask Claude to explain concepts:
```
Explain SQL injection with examples. Show me how to test for it safely.
```

### Phase 2: Set Up Your Lab (Week 2-3)

**Tools to Install:**
```bash
# Burp Suite (web proxy)
brew install --cask burp-suite

# OWASP ZAP (alternative to Burp)
brew install --cask owasp-zap

# Nmap (network scanner)
brew install nmap

# Subfinder (subdomain discovery)
brew install subfinder

# Curl (HTTP client)
brew install curl
```

**Practice Apps:**
```bash
# OWASP Juice Shop (vulnerable web app)
cd ~/Documents/Code
git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git
cd juice-shop
npm install
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

**Claude Code Tip:** Use Claude to help set up:
```
Help me install OWASP Juice Shop and run it locally
```

### Phase 3: Learn with Shannon (Week 3-4)

**Shannon = Your AI Pentesting Teacher**

1. **Run Shannon on Juice Shop:**
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Code/shannon

# Clone Juice Shop to repos/
git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git ./repos/juice-shop

# Start Juice Shop
cd repos/juice-shop && npm install && npm start &

# Run Shannon
./shannon start URL=http://localhost:3000 REPO=juice-shop
```

2. **Watch and Learn:**
- Monitor with `./shannon logs`
- Read the report Shannon generates
- Study the exploits Shannon finds
- Reproduce them manually

3. **Understand the Techniques:**
```
Shannon found SQL injection. Let me try it manually with Burp Suite.
```

**Claude Code Tip:**
```
Read Shannon's report for Juice Shop and explain how the SQL injection works
```

### Phase 4: Build Your Own Tests (Month 2)

**Start with Your Own Apps:**
```bash
# Test checkcheck (this project)
cd ~/Documents/Code/checkcheck
npm start  # Run on localhost:3000

# Run custom test
cd brute/tools
node test-checkcheck.js
```

**What to Test:**
- Login rate limiting (does it work?)
- Session security (can I steal sessions?)
- Input validation (can I inject code?)
- Authorization (can I access other users' data?)

**Claude Code Tip:**
```
Help me write a test to check if checkcheck's rate limiting works
```

### Phase 5: Document and Share (Month 3+)

**Write Pentest Reports:**
```markdown
# Vulnerability Report

## Summary
- **Severity:** High
- **Type:** SQL Injection
- **Location:** /api/login

## Proof of Concept
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin'\'' OR '\''1'\''='\''1","password":"x"}'

## Impact
Complete authentication bypass, database access

## Remediation
Use parameterized queries, never concatenate user input
```

**Claude Code Tip:**
```
Help me write a professional pentest report for the vulnerabilities I found
```

## Legal Framework (CRITICAL)

### ✅ LEGAL
- Your own applications (localhost)
- Practice platforms (THM, HTB, PortSwigger)
- Bug bounty programs (within scope)
- Pentesting contracts (written authorization)

### ❌ ILLEGAL
- Testing without authorization
- Government websites (unless contracted)
- Production systems (unless authorized)
- "Just testing my credentials" (still illegal)

**Key Rule:** Authorization FIRST, testing SECOND.

## Using Claude Code for Pentesting

### Good Prompts

**Learning:**
```
Explain how SSRF works and show me how to test for it safely
```

**Tool Setup:**
```
Help me set up Burp Suite to intercept HTTP requests
```

**Code Analysis:**
```
Review this login code for SQL injection vulnerabilities
[paste code]
```

**Report Writing:**
```
Help me write a CVE-style vulnerability report for this XSS I found
```

### Bad Prompts (Don't Do This)

```
❌ Help me hack facebook.com
❌ Write a script to bruteforce Instagram passwords
❌ How do I bypass rate limiting on [third-party site]
```

## Shannon Workflow

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Recon Phase:**
   - Shannon runs nmap, subfinder, whatweb
   - Maps attack surface
   - Analyzes source code

2. **Vulnerability Analysis:**
   - 5 parallel agents test for: injection, XSS, auth, authz, SSRF
   - Code-aware testing (reads your source)
   - Identifies potential vulnerabilities

3. **Exploitation:**
   - Proves vulnerabilities are exploitable
   - Writes working PoC exploits
   - No exploit = no report (eliminates false positives)

4. **Reporting:**
   - Generates executive summary
   - Includes PoC for each finding
   - Severity ratings + remediation steps

## CheckCheck Example

**Test Rate Limiting:**
```bash
# Start checkcheck
npm start

# Run bruteforce test
cd brute/tools
node test-checkcheck.js

# Check logs
cat ../logs/test-checkcheck.log
```

**Expected Result:**
```
[2026-02-13] Attempt 1: FAILED
[2026-02-13] Attempt 2: FAILED
[2026-02-13] Attempt 3: FAILED
[2026-02-13] Attempt 4: FAILED
[2026-02-13] Attempt 5: FAILED
[2026-02-13] Attempt 6: RATE LIMITED - 429 Too Many Requests
```

**What This Tests:**
- Does rate limiting work? ✅
- Can we bypass it? (Try different techniques)
- How long is the lockout? (15 minutes)
- Are failed attempts logged? (Check audit logs)

## Remember

**You're a pentester when:**
- You have authorization (written, signed, scoped)
- You report findings responsibly
- You help fix vulnerabilities

**You're a criminal when:**
- You test without authorization
- You access data beyond PoC
- You use findings maliciously

The line is clear: **Authorization = Everything**
